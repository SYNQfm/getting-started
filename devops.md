### Test / Deploy / Run

- We use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/dashboard) for Continous Integration
- We use [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to monitor test coverage
- Aim for continuous deployment. Maintainers determine the release cadence but changes _should_ be deployed at least once a week
  - Some services use [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/teams/str8line/apps) with automatic deploys on changes to `master`
